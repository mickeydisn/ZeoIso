Hidden among the dense foliage are three legendary artifacts: the Sylph's Song, the Verdant Emblem, and the Thunder's Grasp. The Sylph's Song, a mystical flute, is rumored to control the movements of the jungle's creatures. The Verdant Emblem, a jade amulet, is believed to grant the power to manipulate the very essence of life. The Thunder's Grasp, a staff of enchanted wood, is said to command the fury of the storms.

These artifacts, steeped in mystery, are revered and feared by the Skyfolk. They are said to hold the key to the jungle's secrets and the balance of its ecosystem.

These relics, hidden deep within the rainforest, are believed to harness the raw power of wind, life, and electricity. As the legends go, these artifacts chose their wielders, granting them extraordinary abilities while challenging their moral compass. The Gale's Breath, for instance, grants the power of flight, but also amplifies the user's fear of heights. The Verdant Vein bestows the power of rapid healing, but at the cost of draining the life force of nearby flora.
